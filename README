#Description:
This project demonstrates AI-driven digital pathology workflows:

Classification (CNN) on the PatchCamelyon dataset for tumor vs. normal tissue patches.

Segmentation (U-Net) on the MoNuSeg dataset for nuclei boundary detection.

Tech Stack: Python, TensorFlow/Keras, OpenCV, scikit-learn.

Features:

Automated dataset preprocessing (resizing, normalization, augmentation).

CNN for binary classification achieving ~85% accuracy.

U-Net for segmentation with sample predictions.

End-to-end reproducible Colab notebook.
